# ComparingRnaSequences

## Case study: comparing ribosomal RNA sequences between humans and bacteria.

### Main lib used was **matplotlib.**

#### Used data:
  * Human 18S rRNA gene, complete.
    *  **source:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/M10098.1?report=fasta
  
  * Escherichia coli strain U 5/41 16S ribosomal RNA gene, partial sequence.
    *  **source:** https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NR_024570.1?report=fasta
  
## Final result:
### As a final result, was generated a figure that visually compare DNAs.
